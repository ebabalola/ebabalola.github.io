    <h1>High School DO's & DONT'S</h1>
    <p id="fp"> Hello! My name is Esther.I'm a rising junior attending KIPP NYC College Prep. 
    I am very passionate about music and making my future successful based on the actions I take in High School. I love to sing, and occassionly read.
    I wish to become a dentist in the future and if there is time I would like to advance to becoming a orthodontist because I had brace for a few years 
    and once you have braces you are required to go for a checkup every month. Every month I went they did something different and I have been interested in it ever since.
    Since I am a rising senior I now have to focus on college applications. Yikes! Luckily I will have a lot of guidance from the college counselors at my school.
    At this point my dream school is Stony Brook, but it's has been changing constantly because ther is a lot of scholls in the country.</p>
