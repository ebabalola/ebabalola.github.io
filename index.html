    <h1>High School DO's & DONT'S</h1>
    <p id="fp"> Hello! My name is Esther.I'm a rising junior attending KIPP NYC College Prep. 
    I am very passionate about music and making my future successful based on the actions I take in High School. I love to sing, and occassionly read.
    I wish to become a dentist in the future and if there is time I would like to advance to becoming a orthodontist because I had brace for a few years 
    and once you have braces you are required to go for a checkup every month. Every month I went they did something different and I have been interested in it ever since.
    Since I am a rising senior I now have to focus on college applications. Yikes! Luckily I will have a lot of guidance from the college counselors at my school.
    At this point my dream school is Stony Brook, but it's has been changing constantly because ther is a lot of scholls in the country.</p>

     <p>Grade will always come first, if you are on a sports team, choir, dance team make sure your grades are good. And of they are not be sure to tak the time off to get your grades up there because when the semester ended youll have many regrets about putting you clubs before your grades. DON'T say I didn't warn you. </p>
